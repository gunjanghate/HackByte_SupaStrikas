Sure! Here's a polished and professional **README.md** tailored for your GitHub project [`HackByte_SupaStrikas`](https://github.com/DhruvTambekar24/HackByte_SupaStrikas). Based on your previous ideas, this assumes it’s a **blockchain-powered anonymous corruption reporting platform** with features like IPFS, encryption, and geotagging.

# DeFIR – Anonymous Corruption Reporting Platform

> 💬 “Speak up. Stay safe.” – A secure and decentralized platform to report corruption anonymously and immutably.

WhistleChain empowers citizens to report corruption without fear, leveraging **blockchain**, **IPFS**, and **encryption** to ensure anonymity, data integrity, and transparency.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Anonymous Complaint Filing**  
  Report incidents without revealing identity. No login required.

- 🧾 **Blockchain-based Logging**  
  All complaints are stored immutably on-chain, ensuring no deletions or tampering.

- 📁 **Encrypted Evidence Uploads**  
  Upload supporting files (images/videos) securely using [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/). Optionally encrypted using steganography.

- 📍 **Geo-Tagging & Metadata**  
  Automatically tags location, department, and issue type using AI & GPS.

- 📊 **Public Transparency Dashboard**  
  Displays live complaint stats by region, department, and status.

- 🧬 **ZKPs (optional)**  
  Integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs to verify authenticity without compromising identity.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User visits app** – No login or identity required.
2. **Fills complaint form** – Describes issue, optionally uploads evidence.
3. **Location auto-tagged** – Or entered manually.
4. **Uploads sent to IPFS** – Gets CID (content identifier).
5. **Complaint stored on blockchain** – CID + metadata stored immutably.
6. **Visible on dashboard** – For transparency & reform analysis.
