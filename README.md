## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User visits app** – No login or identity required.
2. **Fills complaint form** – Describes issue, optionally uploads evidence.
3. **Location auto-tagged** – Or entered manually.
4. **Uploads sent to IPFS** – Gets CID (content identifier).
5. **Complaint stored on blockchain** – CID + metadata stored immutably.
6. **Visible on dashboard** – For transparency & reform analysis.
